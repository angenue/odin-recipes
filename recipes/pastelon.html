    <h2>Rice and Dominican Style Salami</h2>
    <p>
        Rice dish from the Dominican Republic. It consists of seasoned rice with 
        some kind of meat, such as chicken, Dominican salami or pork. We use Dominican 
        salami in this recipe, not Italian salami. This is a hearty and filling meal 
        all by itself, but you can serve it with Dominican beans, Tostones (Fried 
        Plantains), a side salad or with veggies.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>rice</li>
        <li>Dominican Salami</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>tomato sauce</li>
        <li>mashed garlic</li>
        <li>adobo seasoning</li>
        <li>dried oregano</li>
        <li>sofrito</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In an aluminum pot or cast iron heat half the oil over medium heat.
                Add the salami or sausage and cook stirring to brown.</li>
                <li>Add seasoning and vegetables. Cook and stir for a minute.

                    Stir in tomato sauce followed by 4 cups of water and salt. 
                    Decrease the heat to medium and bring to a boil.</li>
                    <li>When the water reaches a rolling boil, add the rice and cook,
                         stirring regularly to prevent it from sticking to the bottom. 
                         When almost all the liquid has evaporated, cover with a 
                         tight-fitting lid and cook over very low heat (but enough to 
                         generate steam) for 10 minutes.</li>
                         <li>As soon as the rice is ready, remove it from the pot and 
                            place it in a serving dish (this prevents the conc√≥n from 
                            getting soggy).</li>
        </ol>
