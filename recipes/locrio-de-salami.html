    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <h6>For the filling</h6>
            <li>Heat oil over medium-low heat. Stir in onion and cook and 
                stir until it turns translucent. Add garlic and cook stirring 
                for a minute.

                Add minced meat and cook and stir, breaking into small clumps 
                until it browns.</li>
                <li>Pour in tomato sauce, add bell pepper, salt, and pepper. Stir 
                    and cover. Simmer for 3 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Uncover and mix in the optional ingredient of your choice, 
                        or none at all if you so prefer.

                        Taste and season with salt and pepper to taste if needed. 
                        Remove from the heat.</li>

                        <h6>To assemble</h6>
                         <li>Peel the plantains and boil adding 1 teaspoon of salt to 
                            the water. Once the plantains are fork tender (15 - 20 mins), 
                            remove them from the heat.</li>
                            <li>Take the plantains out of the water right away, and 
                                mash them with a fork. 

                                Add the butter and keep mashing until it is very smooth 
                                with no lumps. </li>
                                <li>Grease a 1-inch tall baking pan. Put half of the 
                                    plantain mixture in the baking pan. Cover with half 
                                    of the cheese. 

                                    Cover the cheese with the meat. Cover with the remaining 
                                    plantain mixture. Cover with the rest of the cheese.</li>
                                    <li>Cook in preheated oven to 350 °F [175 °C] until the 
                                        top is golden brown.</li>
