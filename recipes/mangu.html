    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 plantains (green, unripe)</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons of butter or olive oil</li>
        <li>1.5 teaspoons salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the plantains and cut lengthwise, then divide each half into two.</li>
                <li>Boil the plantains in enough water to cover them plus an inch until 
                    they are very tender, having added the salt to the water before the 
                    water breaks the boil.</li>
                    <li>Remove the plantains from the water and mash them right away with 
                        a fork until they are very smooth and there are few to no lumps 
                        (be careful not to burn yourself).

                        Mix in butter, and progressively add a cup of water at room temperature 
                        and keep mashing and mixing until it turns into a very smooth puree 
                        (see tips below).</li>
        </ol>
